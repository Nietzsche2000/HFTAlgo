This script is designed to collect, process, and analyze market data from Steam, specifically focusing on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) items. It fetches historical price data, calculates various statistics like elasticity and percent changes, and merges data from different sources for comprehensive analysis.

Key Features
Data Collection: Fetches historical market data from Steam.
Elasticity Calculation: Computes price elasticity based on average prices and volumes.
Percent Change Computation: Calculates day-to-day and week-to-week percent changes in prices.
Dataframe Update: Enhances data with new metrics and US holiday information.
Data Merging: Merges and preprocesses data from different CS:GO related data sources.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
requests: For HTTP requests to fetch market data.
json: To parse JSON data.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
datetime: To handle dates and times.
pandas.tseries.holiday: To handle US federal holidays.

How to Run
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Replace cookie and game_id in the main() function with appropriate values.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
